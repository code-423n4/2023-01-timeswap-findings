## Minimization of truncation
The number of divisions in an equation should be reduced to minimize truncation frequency, serving to achieve higher precision. And, where deemed fit, comment the code line with the original multiple division arithmetic operation for clarity reason.

For instance, the code line below involving two divisions may be refactored as follows:

[File: Math.sol#L77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/Math.sol#L77)

```diff
-                estimate = (value / estimate + estimate) >> 1;
+                estimate = (value + estimate * estimate) / (estimate * 2);
```
## Lines too long
Lines in source code are typically limited to 80 characters, but itâ€™s reasonable to stretch beyond this limit when need be as monitor screens theses days are comparatively larger. Considering the files will most likely reside in GitHub that will have a scroll bar automatically kick in when the length is over 164 characters, all code lines and comments should be split when/before hitting this length. Keep line width to max 120 characters for better readability where possible.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: StrikeConversion.sol#L27](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/StrikeConversion.sol#L27)
[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L31-L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L31-L34)
[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L293-L297](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L293-L297)

## Inappropriate error thrown
The second if block of `create()` in TimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol throws `Error.zeroAddress()` if `pair != address(0)`, which is misleading. 

Consider having the affected code line refactored as follows to avoid any confusion to the users/developers:

Note: The suggested error may have to be added/implemented in [Error.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/Error.sol).

[File: TimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol#L59-L70](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol#L59-L70)

```diff
    function create(address optionPair) external override returns (address pair) {
        if (optionPair == address(0)) Error.zeroAddress();

        pair = pairs[optionPair];
-        if (pair != address(0)) Error.zeroAddress();
+        if (pair != address(0)) Error.alreadyCreatedPool();

        pair = deploy(address(this), optionPair, transactionFee, protocolFee);

        pairs[optionPair] = pair;

        emit Create(msg.sender, optionPair, pair);
    }
```
## Solidity's Style Guide on contract layout
According to Solidity's Style Guide below:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html

In order to help readers identify which functions they can call, and find the constructor and fallback definitions more easily, functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following manner:

constructor, receive function (if exists), fallback function (if exists), external, public, internal, private

And, within a grouping, place the view and pure functions last.

Additionally, inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:

type declarations, state variables, events, modifiers, functions

Consider adhering to the above guidelines for all contract instances entailed.
 
## Inadequate NatSpec
Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec) to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. Please visit the following link for further details:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/natspec-format.html

For instance, it will be of added values to the users and developers if:
- `@ return` is also provided on the functions of [ConstantSum.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/libraries/ConstantSum.sol).
- at least a minimalist NatSpec is provided on [FeesPosition.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-token/src/structs/FeesPosition.sol).

## Inappropriate comment
The return code line in the function below entails only a simple addition that is devoid of division. The comment, `truncation is desired` is therefore deemed non-matching. Consider removing/editing the comment where possible:

[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L82-L84](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L82-L84) 

```solidity
    function blockTimestamp(uint96 durationForward) internal view virtual returns (uint96) {
        return uint96(block.timestamp + durationForward); // truncation is desired
    }
```
