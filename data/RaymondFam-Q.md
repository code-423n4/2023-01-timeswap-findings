## Minimization of truncation
The number of divisions in an equation should be reduced to minimize truncation frequency, serving to achieve higher precision. And, where deemed fit, comment the code line with the original multiple division arithmetic operation for clarity reason.

For instance, the code line below involving two divisions may be refactored as follows:

[File: Math.sol#L77](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/Math.sol#L77)

```diff
-                estimate = (value / estimate + estimate) >> 1;
+                estimate = (value + estimate * estimate) / (estimate * 2);
```
## Lines too long
Lines in source code are typically limited to 80 characters, but itâ€™s reasonable to stretch beyond this limit when need be as monitor screens theses days are comparatively larger. Considering the files will most likely reside in GitHub that will have a scroll bar automatically kick in when the length is over 164 characters, all code lines and comments should be split when/before hitting this length. Keep line width to max 120 characters for better readability where possible.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

[File: StrikeConversion.sol#L27](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/StrikeConversion.sol#L27)
[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L31-L34](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L31-L34)
[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L293-L297](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L293-L297)

## Inappropriate error thrown
The second if block of `create()` in TimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol throws `Error.zeroAddress()` if `pair != address(0)`, which is misleading. 

Consider having the affected code line refactored as follows to avoid any confusion to the users/developers:

Note: The suggested error may have to be added/implemented in [Error.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/Error.sol).

[File: TimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol#L59-L70](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol#L59-L70)

```diff
    function create(address optionPair) external override returns (address pair) {
        if (optionPair == address(0)) Error.zeroAddress();

        pair = pairs[optionPair];
-        if (pair != address(0)) Error.zeroAddress();
+        if (pair != address(0)) Error.alreadyCreatedPool();

        pair = deploy(address(this), optionPair, transactionFee, protocolFee);

        pairs[optionPair] = pair;

        emit Create(msg.sender, optionPair, pair);
    }
```
## Solidity's Style Guide on contract layout
According to Solidity's Style Guide below:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html

In order to help readers identify which functions they can call, and find the constructor and fallback definitions more easily, functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered in the following manner:

constructor, receive function (if exists), fallback function (if exists), external, public, internal, private

And, within a grouping, place the view and pure functions last.

Additionally, inside each contract, library or interface, use the following order:

type declarations, state variables, events, modifiers, functions

Consider adhering to the above guidelines for all contract instances entailed.
 
## Inadequate NatSpec
Solidity contracts can use a special form of comments, i.e., the Ethereum Natural Language Specification Format (NatSpec) to provide rich documentation for functions, return variables and more. Please visit the following link for further details:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/natspec-format.html

For instance, it will be of added values to the users and developers if:
- `@ return` is also provided on the functions of [ConstantSum.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/libraries/ConstantSum.sol).
- at least a minimalist NatSpec is provided on [FeesPosition.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-token/src/structs/FeesPosition.sol).

## Inappropriate comment
The return code line in the function below entails only a simple addition that is devoid of division. The comment, `truncation is desired` is therefore deemed non-matching. Consider removing/editing the comment where possible:

[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L82-L84](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L82-L84) 

```solidity
    function blockTimestamp(uint96 durationForward) internal view virtual returns (uint96) {
        return uint96(block.timestamp + durationForward); // truncation is desired
    }
```
## Erroneous function NatSpec
[File: ITimeswapV2PoolDeployer.sol#L11-L18](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/interfaces/ITimeswapV2PoolDeployer.sol#L11-L18)

```diff
    /// @notice Get the parameters to be used in constructing the pair, set transiently during pair creation.
    /// @dev Called by the pair constructor to fetch the parameters of the pair.
    /// @return poolFactory The poolFactory address.
-    /// @param optionPair The Timeswap V2 OptionPair address.
+    /// @return optionPair The Timeswap V2 OptionPair address.
-    /// @param transactionFee The transaction fee earned by the liquidity providers.
+    /// @return transactionFee The transaction fee earned by the liquidity providers.
-    /// @param protocolFee The protocol fee earned by the DAO.
+    /// @return protocolFee The protocol fee earned by the DAO.
    function parameter() external view returns (address poolFactory, address optionPair, uint256 transactionFee, uint256 protocolFee);
}
```
[File: ITimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol#L37-L42](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/interfaces/ITimeswapV2PoolFactory.sol#L37-L42)

```diff
    /// @dev Creates a Timeswap V2 Pool based on option parameter.
    /// @dev Cannot create a duplicate Timeswap V2 Pool with the same option parameter.
    /// @param option The address of the option contract used by the pool.
-    /// @param poolPair The address of the Timeswap V2 Pool contract created.
+    /// @return poolPair The address of the Timeswap V2 Pool contract created.
    function create(address option) external returns (address poolPair);
}
```
## Missing zero value checks
When initializing the pool, a boundary and a zero value check has correspondingly been applied on `maturity` and `rate`.

A zero value check should likewise be executed on `strike` to make the input parameters of `initialize()` more error free:

(Note: Additionally, the zero value checks is suggested moving to the first line of the function logic so it could become the first line of defense to revert the earliest if need be.) 

[File: TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L175-L181](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/TimeswapV2Pool.sol#L175-L181)

```diff
    function initialize(uint256 strike, uint256 maturity, uint160 rate) external override noDelegateCall {
+        if (rate == 0 || strike == 0) Error.cannotBeZero();
        if (maturity < blockTimestamp(0)) Error.alreadyMatured(maturity, blockTimestamp(0));
-        if (rate == 0) Error.cannotBeZero();
        addPoolEnumerationIfNecessary(strike, maturity);

        pools[strike][maturity].initialize(rate);
    }
```
## Use `delete` to clear variables
`delete a` assigns the initial value for the type to `a`. i.e. for integers it is equivalent to `a = 0`, but it can also be used on arrays, where it assigns a dynamic array of length zero or a static array of the same length with all elements reset. For structs, it assigns a struct with all members reset. Similarly, it can also be used to set an address to zero address or a boolean to false. It has no effect on whole mappings though (as the keys of mappings may be arbitrary and are generally unknown). However, individual keys and what they map to can be deleted: If `a` is a mapping, then `delete a[x]` will delete the value stored at x.

The delete key better conveys the intention and is also more idiomatic.

For instance, the `a = 0` instance below may be refactored as follows:

[File: Pool.sol#L685](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/structs/Pool.sol#L685)

```diff
-                    pool.long1Balance = 0;
+                    delete pool.long1Balance;
```
## Variable Assignment in Conditional Check
Making a variable assignment in a conditional statement deviates from the standard use and intention of the check and can easily lead to confusion.

Here are the instances entailed that should have the needed assignment cached before the conditional statement as follows:

[File: Pool.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/structs/Pool.sol)

```diff
- 681:                if ((long1Amount = param.delta) == long1AmountAdjustFees) {

+                long1Amount = param.delta);
+                if (long1Amount == long1AmountAdjustFees) {

- 702:                if ((long0Amount = param.delta) == long0AmountAdjustFees) {

+                long0Amount = param.delta);
+                if (long0Amount == long0AmountAdjustFees) {
```
## Sort _tokenA and _takenB on create()
In `create()` of TimeswapV2OptionFactory.sol, instead of reverting the function if the tokens have not been sorted, consider having the function logic refactored as follows to better facilitate the function call:

[File: TimeswapV2OptionFactory.sol#L43-L56](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-option/src/TimeswapV2OptionFactory.sol#L43-L56)

```diff
    function create(address token0, address token1) external override returns (address optionPair) {
        if (token0 == address(0)) Error.zeroAddress();
        if (token1 == address(0)) Error.zeroAddress();
-        OptionPairLibrary.checkCorrectFormat(token0, token1);
+        (token0_, token1_) = token0 < token1 ? (token0, token1) : (token1, token0);
-        optionPair = optionPairs[token0][token1];
+        optionPair = optionPairs[token0_][token1_];
-        OptionPairLibrary.checkDoesNotExist(token0, token1, optionPair);
+        OptionPairLibrary.checkDoesNotExist(token0_, token1_, optionPair);

-        optionPair = deploy(address(this), token0, token1);
+        optionPair = deploy(address(this), token0_, token1_);

-        optionPairs[token0][token1] = optionPair;
+        optionPairs[token0_][token1_] = optionPair;

-        emit Create(msg.sender, token0, token1, optionPair);
+        emit Create(msg.sender, token0_, token1_, optionPair);
    }
```
## Comment and documentation mismatch
According to the [whitepaper](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/whitepaper.pdf),

z/(x+y) is the marginal interest (I) rate per second of the Short (z) per total Long (x + y).

However, it is stated differently in the NatSpec comment below which should be corrected as follows: 

[File: ITimeswapV2Pool.sol#L170](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/interfaces/ITimeswapV2Pool.sol#L170)

```
-    /// @dev the square root of interest rate is z/(x+y) where z is the short amount, x+y is the long0 amount, and y is the long1 amount.
+    /// @dev the square root of interest rate is sqrt(z/(x+y)) where z is the short amount, x is the long0 amount, and y is the long1 amount.
```
## Return statement on named returns
Functions with named returns should not have a return statement to avoid unnecessary confusion.

For instance, the following `min()` may be refactored as:

[File: Math.sol#L88-L90](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-library/src/Math.sol#L88-L90)

```diff
    function min(uint256 value1, uint256 value2) internal pure returns (uint256 result) {
-        return value1 < value2 ? value1 : value2;
+        result = value1 < value2 ? value1 : value2;
    }
```
## Use a more recent version of solidity
The protocol adopts version 0.8.8 on writing contracts. For better security, it is best practice to use the latest Solidity version, 0.8.17.

Security fix list in the versions can be found in the link below:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md
