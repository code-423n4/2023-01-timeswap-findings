## 02 Using both named returns and a return statement isn't necessary 

Removing unused named returns variables can reduce gas usage (MSTOREs/MLOADs) and improve code clarity. To save gas and improve code quality: consider using only one of those.

## 03 Don't use periods with fragments

Throughout the files, most of the comments have fragments that end with periods. They should either be converted to actual sentences with both a noun phrase and a verb phrase, or the periods should be removed.

_There are multiple instances of this issue. This exists in all contracts_

For instance,

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-timeswap/blob/main/packages/v2-pool/src/libraries/PoolPair.sol

```
File: main/packages/v2-pool/src/libraries/PoolPair.sol

5: /// @dev Reverts when swap address is zero.
8: /// @dev Reverts when the Timeswap V2 Pool already exist.
10: /// @param poolPair The address of the existed Timeswap V2 Pair contract.
13: /// @dev Checks if option address is not zero.
14: /// @param poolPair The address being checked upon.
19: /// @dev Checks if the pool doesn not exist.
20: /// @param optionPair The address of the TimeswapV2Option contract.
21: /// @param poolPair The address of the TimeswapV2Pool contract.

## 04 Use a more recent version of solidity

It's a best practice to use the latest compiler version.

The specified minimum compiler version is quite old. Older compilers might be susceptible to some bugs. We recommend changing the solidity version pragma to the latest version to enforce the use of an up to date compiler.

List of known compiler bugs and their severity can be found here:Â [https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo](https://etherscan.io/solcbuginfo)

This issue exists in all the In-scope contracts

----------

## 05 Non-library or interface files should use fixed compiler versions, not floating ones

In the contracts, floating pragmas should not be used. Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.
